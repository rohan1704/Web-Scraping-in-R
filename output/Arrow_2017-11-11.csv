"Arrow",2017-11-10," This show is ridiculous and unconvincing. Dialogues are awful, acting is bad and the script is insulting viewer's intelligence. Mother's secrets could have been a great show for itself and are, along with the island flashbacks the only reason I'm still watching. The bad guys and villains aren't scary at all, action scenes aren't exciting, some of the actors have a charisma of a cooked octopus when they're trying to be tough; that's actually funny from time to time. Absolutely the worst part are the relations between characters driven by kindergarten dialogues which are embarrassing to watch and listen. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-11-10," This was one of the best TV shows you watch for comic book genre, It started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action, suspense and a good story-line, suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch, no suspense, no general direction of the character, in almost every episode its the same dialogue  Oliver if you want them to trust you, you should let them know who you are, and Oliver takes of his eye piece and says  I am the Green Arrow  L.O.L What Dafuq.The show is just going down hill, specially that now the main character is now Felicity (sleeps with all the Billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll) worst character, Thea Queen 2nd billionaire famous line  I am out . Just keep the group small and the action hardcore like 1st season, identity reveal yeah stop that, let the character start killing again, and please don't bring dead people back to make their own show.Season 1 - Great. Season 2 - Just OK. Season 3 - What is happening.Season 4 - Why are you killing the show. Season 5 - I give up, cant watch anymore. Season 6 - Stopped watching. ","7"
"Arrow",2017-11-07," The action of Arrow is awesome! but i feel that it has become a little boring because there is absolutely no humor, Felicity talks too much, and many other flaws. Thats why i give it a 4/10 rating. Otherwise, the series' action is perfect.#Flashfan ","4"
"Arrow",2017-11-03," This show is amazing and it gets better each day . Season 6 is spectacular. This is the best DCTV show in the Arrowverse. The show matures and grows each year . The leads of the show are spectacular and their chemistry is legendary . Great cast . Great story. Got a hold of this show last year and if I had blindly followed the haters remarks online, I would not have tried to check it out on my own . Guess what ? The show is amazing !! ","10"
"Arrow",2017-10-27," I really loved this show at first but its become very hit and miss as to weather an episode is any good or not. It started out great (8/10) it was kinda dark and ruthless but unfortunately the writers started emphasizing on the characters feelings way too much. Also the fight scenes although slightly better now became super cheesy and felt like I was watching power rangers around season 4.I really hope that they start focusing more on the villains and plot more again. Also it definitely wouldn't bother me if they killed off most of the annoying cast members. ","6"
"Arrow",2017-10-27," The First Season Of Arrow is a Great Season, it doesn't even feel like a superhero show (in a good way) the action scenes and flash backs are great and look like a scene from Mission Impossible or Kingsmen! The villain is top notch, the emotion is there, absolute greatness. Sure, it stalls here and there but that's expected when you have to fill 23 hours. the first season is great 8.75/10 IMOThe second is best so far, Deathstroke is the best villain, other than him the villain of the week's are also great e.g. the doll maker and clock king. the flash backs are also the greatest 9.5/10 IMOthe third season is where things go downhill, till the mid season it was shaping up to be great but after  The Climb  It became really mediocre, Ra's AL ghoul was an okay villain and the finale was really anti climatic. 6/10 IMOThe fourth is the worst. there is realistic feel to it, Damien Dahrk is a magician while Oliver is only an archer/hand to hand fighter. Thus the stakes are raised too high also Schism is the second worst episode ever. 5/10 IMOThe fifth season is a revival and is the second best season, Prometheus is a phenomenal villain and the stakes have been taken down a notch (THANK GOD) the finale is the best episode ever of Arrow, the only bad episode was  Underneath  and its quite possibly the WORST EPISODE TOO. 9/10 IMOoverall you will have a blast with the first two seasons, will have to sit through the bore that is season 3 and 4 and will be hooked at season 5, HIGH HOPES FOR SEASON 6 ","8"
"Arrow",2017-10-21," Like with Smallville and The Flash I have not seen every single episode but on some occasions, I do watch this show but only when there is a crossover or a certain actor in a particular episode. Like Peter Stormare who did good acting as Count Vertigo for two episodes and Matt Ryan who was John Constantine for one episode which was very funny. I also think Stephen Amell did great as Green Arrow and Felicity Smoke is pretty hot like Cathlin Snow from The Flash is. It is an okay show but it is not as interesting or likable as The Flash or Smallville. ","6"
"Arrow",2017-10-17," Every year Arrow is becoming more boring . 1st and 2nd Season of Arrow is very interesting great Story. But is seems after 2nd Season their are lack in Story Writing. Same old type of Stories Nothing new and interesting .As a fan of Arrow I am very disappointed and i expect more from Arrow. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-10-10," The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring. I decided to give up less than half way through season 5. The flashbacks become uninteresting. The villains after 2 seasons are boring. Love story is soap opera material. Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic. Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-10-04," The first two seasons of Arrow were brilliantly done. The cinematography was illuminating, and it had a good plot. Somewhere along the line, though, the writing went south, and I know where we can point a finger to: Marc Guggenheim. It's bad enough that he killed off Laurel, but apparently, he wants another to take up the mantle. Rather than giving it to her Earth 2 counterpart, like any ordinary writer does, he gives it to a character named Tina Boland, whose real name is apparently Dinah Drake. Never mind that the real Dinah actually appeared before, and that she was Laurel's mother! I swear, I don't know how in the world these writers are able to find jobs. They suck at it. Then there's the Felicity relationship. Not a bad character, but when you focus on shipping these two together, when clearly, within the comic books, Green Arrow and Black Canary are an item from day one! And she constantly makes some of the most bone headed plays, yet Oliver never calls her out for it. He's such a wuss. He's not Green Arrow. Green Arrow is funny, witty and doesn't mope around. Stephen Amell is a good actor, but they should have stopped the whole Batman persona around Season Two or Three. They had a chance to make things right with Season Four, yet they come away from that one even worse. And they didn't even know who was going to end up in the grave. Really? You threw the grave plot line out there, without knowing WHO was going to end up in it? To this day, I still say William, Oliver's son, should have been the one who died. This would have made his fight against Damien Darhk much more personal. In fact, who wouldn't have wanted him to die? John Barrowman is a good actor, but they've lost all use for him. Oliver's excuses for letting him live fall flat when he sold out his son in exchange for protection. To me, that's unforgivable. I'm sorry, writers, but you have failed this show. If you want to keep me interested, fire the show-runners. Better yet, cancel the show, before you make things much worse. ","7"
