#### Web scraping is used for extracting data from websites.

#### In R it can be done with ‘rvest’ package, authored by Hadley Wickham.

#### The website used in this project is IMDb review page for the show "Arrow".

#### All the scrapped data is then stored in a dataframe, and saved in a csv file with show's name and system date.
